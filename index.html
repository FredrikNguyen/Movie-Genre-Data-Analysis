            <p class="small-text"><em>It’s a Saturday night and you want to watch a movie.
                 You remember a friend of yours recommending a musical on Disney+, so you think,
                  why not? and start the search for it. Once you find it, its genres catch your eye: 
                  Biography and History. You grimace a little and consider going back to search for something else. 
                  As much as you enjoy musicals, historical fiction is really not your cup of tea. How good can a historical, 
                biographical, musical be anyway? Your friend told you to watch it though, so you have no choice.</em></p>
    
            <p class="small-text"><em>And so, you watch the musical. To your surprise,
                 it’s good. The movie made you smile, it made you laugh, it made you 
                 want to sing along even if you knew none of the words. It was not all 
                 sunshine and rainbows though. There was drama, there was conflict, there 
                 was pain. Three quarters through the movie, you were crying your eyes out.</em> </p>
                
            <p class="small-text"><em>As the credits roll, you think back to the genres. 
                Biography, History. Are they correct? Grudgingly, you have to admit they are, 
                but still, you feel like they were not enough. With those genres, were it not for
                 your friend, you would have never given this movie a try. Whoever labeled this movie
                  should’ve done better. </em> </p>
                
            <p class="small-text"><em>When you go to sleep that night, you start to wonder…

    <h4 id="intro" class="section-titles">Why Dive Into the Genre Jungle When We Could Just Watch Netflix? <br> <em>~A Generic Introduction~</em></h4> 
    
    <p class="main-text">Movies are more than just entertainment — they are windows into 
        stories that inspire, thrill, and move us. With over a century of cinema and thousands 
        of movies spanning genres like drama, action, romance, horror, and sci-fi, there’s always
         a perfect film waiting to match your mood. But here’s the catch: how do you choose?</p>
    <p class="main-text">When scrolling through endless options on Netflix or Disney+, 
        the genre is often our guiding light. It tells us what to expect — a nail-biting 
        thriller, a heartwarming comedy, or a mind-bending sci-fi adventure. 
        But how accurate are these genres? How often do they represent the true essence of the movie?</p>
    <p class="main-text">This question sparked our curiosity. What if movies could 
        speak for themselves? What if their data — runtime, actors,
         themes, even emotions — could automatically reveal the genres they truly belong to?</p>
    <p class="main-text">In this project, we dive into the fascinating world of movie genres to 
        uncover the characteristics that define them. From analyzing hidden patterns in data to 
        testing machine learning models, we set out to answer one big question:
        <b>Can we predict a movie’s genre using only its data?</b></p>
    <p class="main-text">Ready to see movies in a new light? Let’s begin!</p>


    <h3 id="data" class="section-titles">Data <em>~In Action~</em></h4>
    <p class="main-text">To explore what truly defines a movie genre, we needed data — and lots of it. 
        The backbone of our 
        analysis is two extensive datasets, each offering a unique glimpse into the world of cinema:</p>

    <h5 class="sub-titles">1. The <s>MCU</s> CMU Movie Summary Corpus</h5>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="text-section">
            <p>This dataset, sourced from movie summaries on Wikipedia as of 2012, 
                provides detailed information for over 42,000 movies. It includes key attributes such 
                as movie titles, release dates, genres, and plot summaries, giving us a textual and structural 
                foundation to analyze what movies are made of. Beyond movies themselves, characters are at the 
                heart of every story. This dataset also dives deep into the personas of movie characters, covering 
                actor details like age, gender, and character roles. It also includes character-related data such 
                as stereotypes, 
                age groups, and sentiment, providing insights into how characters shape and reflect genres.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <h5 class="sub-titles">2. The TMDb Dataset</h5>
    <p class="main-sub-text">To enrich our exploration, we incorporated the publicly available 
        dataset TMDb (The Movie Database). This dataset adds layers of information such as runtime,
         budgets, revenues, 
        popularity, and votes, helping us understand how movie characteristics vary across genres.</p>
    
    
    <p class="main-text"> By combining these datasets, we ended up with a rich collection of movie 
        and character data, spanning decades of cinematic history — from the early 20th century to 2016. 
        Altogether, this means analyzing tens of thousands of movies and characters, each contributing 
        to the intricate puzzle of genre classification.
       </p>
  
    <p class="main-text">With this treasure trove of information, we’re ready to uncover the patterns and relationships that define movie genres. 
        From plot lengths to actor demographics, our data helps movies speak for themselves.</p>


    <p class="main-text"><b>Now, with the help of our datasets, we can start by looking at some general facts about movies.</b></p>
    
    <h5 class="sub-titles">Movies Through the Decades: A Cinematic Boom</h5>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="text-section">
            <p>As we can see, movies have become a significant part of our lives and a cornerstone of entertainment.
                <br><br>In the early years (before the 1920s), movie production was sparse as the film industry was still in its infancy. As technology advanced and filmmaking became more accessible, we see a steady rise in the number of films produced, particularly from the 1930s onward.
                <br><br>Interestingly, there are noticeable dips around the 1940s, likely due to World War II, which disrupted global film production. However, the industry rebounded post-war, continuing to grow steadily through the mid-20th century.

        </div>
    </div>

    
    <p class="main-sub-text">The real explosion in movie production occurs from the 1980s onwards, reaching its peak in the early 2000s. This surge can be attributed to:
        <ul class="story-ul">
            <li>Advances in technology and filmmaking techniques.</li>
            <li>The rise of global film markets and independent cinema.</li>
            <li>The accessibility of digital filmmaking, which drastically lowered production costs.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="main-sub-text">Now, let’s dive into the box office battle, where we explore how the data behaves across genres to give us a clear overview of 
        the fascinating relationships between budgets, revenues, and ratings.</p>


    <h5 class="sub-titles">Box Office Battles: Ratings, Revenues, and the Rise of the Blockbuster</h5>
    <p class="main-sub-text">This following graph is like peeking behind the curtain of the movie 
        industry, where romance (blue) and horror (red) duke it out on the battlefield of budgets, revenues, and ratings. Nestled in our "overview of the data" section, this visual spectacle showcases how these genres have entirely 
        different strategies for stealing the audience's hearts—or scaring the popcorn out of their hands.</p>

    <p class="main-text">Like it or not, statistics very much fall into the non-fiction category, so let's take a brief 
        look at this short documentary that will introduce us to two important characters of our journey. </p>


    <h5 class="sub-titles">Pearson Correlation: Linear Relationships</h5>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="text-section">
            <p>The Pearson correlation measures the strength and direction of the 
                linear relationship between two variables. It answers the question: 
                <em>When one variable increases (or decreases), 
                    does the other do the same, and in a predictable way?</em>
            </p>
            <ul class="contained-ul">
                <li>Scale: The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1: Perfect positive linear relationship (as one goes up, the other does too)</li>
                    <li>0: No linear relationship.</li>
                    <li>-1: Perfect negative linear relationship (as one goes up, the other goes down).</li>

                </ul>
                <li>When to Use It: When your data is normally distributed and you expect the relationship between variables to be linear.</li>
            </ul>

    <h5 class="sub-titles">Spearman Correlation: Ranks and Non-Linear Relationships</h5>

        </div>

        <div class="text-section">
            <p>The Spearman correlation, on the other hand, is all about ranks. It measures how well the
                 relationship between two variables can be described by a 
                monotonic function (i.e., consistently increasing or decreasing, but not necessarily in a straight line).
            </p>
            <ul class="contained-ul">
                <li>Scale: Like Pearson, Spearman ranges from -1 to 1.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1: Perfectly monotonic increasing relationship (as one variable’s rank increases, so does the other’s).</li>
                    <li>0: No monotonic relationship.</li>
                    <li>-1: Perfectly monotonic decreasing relationship.</li>

                </ul>
                <li>When to Use It: When your data is not linear or when you’re dealing with ordinal data (e.g., ranks or categories).</li>
            </ul>

    </div>


    <h3 id="genre" class="section-titles">What Makes a Genre? <em>~The Mystery to Investigate~</em></h3> 
    <p class="main-text">Genres are the backbone of cinema. They are the categories that shape our
         expectations and guide us to the stories we love. Whether it’s the thrill of an action-packed chase, 
         the tears of a heartfelt drama, or the 
        laughs of a lighthearted comedy, genres provide the lens through which we view and connect with movies.</p>
    
    <h1>INSERT PIE CHART</h1>

    
    <h5 class="sub-titles">A Slice of the Genre Pie 🍰</h5>

    <p class="main-sub-text">To start off, this delightful pie chart gives us a bird’s-eye 
        view of the distribution of movies across genres. Here’s what stands out:
    
        <ul class="story-ul">
            <li>Drama takes center stage with the largest slice of the pie at 17.7%. No surprise here — drama has always been a storytelling staple, 
                reflecting the depth and complexity of human experiences.</li>
            <li>Comedy (11.4%) follows, reminding us that everyone loves a good laugh.</li>
            <li>Action/Adventure (7.15%) and Romance (6.25%) keep us entertained and swooning, proving that audiences love excitement and love stories alike.</li>
            <li>The smaller slices, like World Cinema and Short Films, highlight niche categories that cater to specialized tastes and artistic expressions.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="section-titles">How Actors Define Genre <em>~A Look Behind The Scenes~</em></h3>
    <p class="main-text">What’s a movie without its actors? They’re the faces we laugh with, cry over, 
        and sometimes yell at for making bad decisions (we’re looking at you, horror movies). But have you 
        ever wondered if the type of actors in a movie — their age, their experience — tells us something about 
        its genre? Maybe action movies lean toward younger, energetic stars, while dramas prefer seasoned veterans 
        with emotional depth. Well, wonder no more! Let’s 
        take a closer look at the fascinating relationship between who’s in a movie and what kind of movie it is.</p>
    
    <h1>INSERT STACKED BARS</h1>


    <h5 class="sub-titles">Stacked Bars of Genre Glory</h5>

    <p class="main-sub-text">The stacked bar chart takes the exploration to the next level. Here, 
        you can compare how different genres 
    allocate their casting across age groups. And yes, it updates dynamically based on your selections!</p>
        <ul class="story-ul">
            <li>If you select action and thrillers, you’ll see a strong focus on actors aged 20-40, the age group of choice for adrenaline-fueled roles.</li>
            <li>Choose comedies and family films, and you’ll notice the 0-20 group taking a bigger chunk — these genres thrive on youthful energy and humor.</li>
            <li>Interested in biographical dramas? The graph will highlight a larger share of 40-60+ actors, reflecting the life stories these genres often depict.</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="main-sub-text">The stacked bar chart takes the exploration to the next level. Here, 
        By comparing genres side by side, you can see how the casting shifts between them. It’s a fun way to explore how each genre tailors its actors to fit its narrative style.
        <br><br> Sure, genres dictate the ages of actors—because apparently, you can’t 
        have a family film without a squad of pre-teens or a historical drama without someone 
        looking wise and weathered. But age isn’t the only casting curveball genres throw. The gender 
        balance in movies can be just as telling! Whether it’s action films that scream, “Bring me all the
         tough guys!” or romantic comedies assembling equal 
        parts swoon-worthy men and quirky women, the genre has a lot to say about who gets the spotlight.

    <h3 class="section-titles">What Stories Tell Us About Genres <em>~The Plots and Twists~</em></h3>
        <p class="main-text">Movies are more than just visuals; their plots shape how we experience them and, ultimately, the genres they belong to. The words used in movie summaries give us a sneak peek into their core themes.
